_Randomly select a position, according to 'half of Bouma's law', draw a radial (or tangential) ellipse with the position as ellipse central. Draw another ellipse and inspect if the two ellipses overlap. If yes, abandon the second position. If no, keep the second position. ... Draw the No. n ellipse, inspect if the ellipse n overlaps with all other drawn ellipses. Keep the ellipse n only if it does not overlap with all the other ellipses. Keep fill the display with ellipses untial no ellipse could be fill in anymore-- ellipse algorithm_

- Idea1: fill display with raidal or tangential ellipses
- Idea2: fill display with ellipse-crosses

>## StimuliSelection
- select displays that match properties between 2 conditions

>## OtherFunctions
- Handy small functions frequently used in experiments and data-preprocessing
